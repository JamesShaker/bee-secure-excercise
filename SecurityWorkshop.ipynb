    "# How do computer systems get attacked?\n",
    "To defend systems, the big question to answer is:\n",
    "- **How** might someone conduct an attack?\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the **how** of a threat is crucial to defending against it. For example, in the physical world we might know that thieves can get into houses by looking for and finding hidden spare keys. Since we know the **how** of the threat we can mitigate against it by putting our spare key in a lockbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do computer systems get attacked? Unfortunately there's no one straightforward answer. There are many different kinds of systems that get attacked in many different ways. In fact, sometimes it's not clear where legitimate, if somewhat creative, usage of a system ends and 'hacking' begins. Nonetheless cyber attacks almost always have the property that they **use a system in a way the creator or owner did not intend and has not authorised** and usually this is done **by finding a flaw, or *vulnerability*, in a system which leads to unexpected behaviour and using it creatively, or *exploiting it* with an *exploit***.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** *The word hacking has a few different meanings apart from the cyber attack meaning. For example you can 'hack away' at some code, meaning just writing and tweaking some computer code (legitimately) to get it to work. It's usually clear from context what people mean.*\n",
    "\n",
    "One common kind of flaw is when a system that takes user input **inadvertently allows the user input to be interpreted by the machine as additional software instructions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a little like if at a fancy restaurant when you were given the bill, rather than just putting your card next to it, you removed the bill and put in your own copy of the bill on which everything was cheaper. The system (the waiter) expects your input to be valid (a credit card) but when you're somewhat creative you change the system's (the waiter's) code (bill), so it behaves in a way (charges you less) that it's developer (manager) doesn't intend or authorise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mistake that makes this possible is unintentional on the part of the application developer (the manager didn't think to tell the waiter to check the restaurant patron hadn't swapped the bill), but abusing that mistake to achieve nefarious ends is most certaintly intentional on the part of the attacker (you definitely meant to swap out the bill to pay less!).\n",
    "\n",
    "This might be a little confusing or vague at this point. Don't worry! We're going to explore this idea better in not one but two hands-on attacks. That is, we're going to hack a website. Twice. \n",
    "\n",
    "But I hear you ask, aren't we the good guys? Indeed we are. But it's not that unusual for the good guys to do some hacking **of their own systems**. Defenders will attack their own websites/software/networks, or bring in teams of friendly attackers to do it, in order to understand the potential vulnerabilities *before* a real malicious attacker exploits them.\n",
    "\n",
    "And thus, for the rest of the workshop we're going to put ourselves in the shoes of would-be attackers."

    "Websites do all sorts of different things. There are websites for sharing videos, checking your bank account, booking flights, and much more. But one thing that is common among many different websites is their ability to *manage information*. Whether that be video files, bank balances, or flight schedules, websites almost always have the functionality to *create* (or add) information, later *read* or *update* that information, and finally *delete* it. Different pieces of information may also have all sorts of links between them that a website manages. For example an airline website contains both user account details and flight schedule details, but then connects to two together to store lists of bookings.\n",

    "Whilst there are many different kinds of databases that a website can use, many of them share a common language \n",
    "called **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a quick example. Suppose our website allows users to login. The database needs to store this. So we might have a *table* of users. When we talk about database tables we're talking about abstract datastructures, but the term is inspired by written tables you might see in books or reports. Just like written tables they have *columns* and *rows*. Each column can hold a particular kind of information, and a row contains a set of entries under each column for one record. For example suppose a table called `users` in a database might look something like this if it was written out:\n",

    "The `users` table has three columns, `id`, `username`, and `password`. They each have a type, `number`, `string`, and `string` respectively. We can see the table has two entries, or rows, each one representing a user.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL `SELECT` queries allow us to get data from tables. We can choose which columns we want from which table. For example if we wanted all of the `username` values from the `users` table we could write the SQL query:\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT username FROM users\n",
    "```\n",
    "This would return `john` and `jane`. We could ask for both `username` and `password`:\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT username, password FROM users\n",
    "```\n",
    "Which would return two pairs, `('john','john_is_cool')` as well as `('jane','jane_is_rad')`. We can also restrict which rows we're interested in with conditions by adding a `WHERE <condition>` on the end. For example if we only wanted `john`'s password:\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT password FROM users WHERE username == 'john'\n",

    "Which would return `john_is_cool`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Excercise**\n",
    "- Can you write an SQL query which finds the id and username of a user with the password 'flying_saucer'?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just the very crude basics of SQL. SQL is a very mature and powerful technology with lots of advanced features.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might not quite seem like it, but in the same way we talked about HTML and JavaScript being code on the client side, SQL is a special form of code that gets executed on the server side (along with many others!).\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve server side code injection, can we try and trick the server into reading our input as SQL? Enter SQL injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQL Injection\n",
    "As we've talked about earlier, a good way to exploit a sytstem is to try and trick it into reading your input as a user as code. This is often possible with SQL code if the programmer of the website hasn't been careful. Consider our example from above. To login to the website the server might need to check a password and so run a query like:\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT password FROM users WHERE username == 'john'\n",
    "```\n",
    "But it needs to be able to run this with whatever username we provide, so what we enter in a text entry box on the login screen might end up inside the query:\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT password FROM users WHERE username == '<user_entry>'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What if the username was `geoff`? \n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT password FROM users WHERE username == 'geoff'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, what if I enter the username `nonsenicalUsername' UNION SELECT 'ChosenString`. I end up with the SQL query:\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT password FROM users WHERE username == 'nonsenicalUsername' UNION SELECT 'ChosenString'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `UNION` allows the results of two SQL queries to be combined into one longer list of results. The first query looks for a password for a user called `'nonsenicalUsername'` and so returns nothing. The second query uses `SELECT` to return a constant value, not from the database. So it returns `'ChosenString'`. Do you see what's happened? We've used `'` in our user input. Since the website just put our string in without checking it carefully, we were able to break out of the original `username ==` spot and start putting in arbitrary SQL.

    "1. We could use this to steal people's secrets more quietly, perhaps? Rather than having their secret sent as a message to the whole chat, it will only be visible to us in the 'Bio Search' results.\n",

    "\n",
    "This can be tricky in general but we'll give you a hand. We're using a database called 'PostgreSQL' version 12.12. This kind of database has a *built-in* table called `pg_tables` which contains a list of all the tables in the database. The `pg_tables` table has a column called `tablename` which sounds pretty useful! So to figure out what tables exist in the database, we need to try and run the SQL query:\n",

    "SELECT ??? FROM ??? WHERE ??? = 'randomJunk' UNION SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is almost right, but notice that pesky `'` on the end! Earlier our `' UNION SELECT 'ChosenString` worked because the final `'` ends the string `'ChosenString'`. Having a `'` dangling will break our query. Perhaps we can just put a `UNION SELECT 'ExtraResult` on the end? So we'll inject in `randomJunk' UNION SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables UNION SELECT 'ExtraResult`. This means the server will probably end up a query that looks something like:\n",

When we're exploiting a complicated system we have to pick and choose what we dig into. If you don't understand what a table name means, at this stage it's probably not something relevant. \n",
